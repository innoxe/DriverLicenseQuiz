# DriverLicenseQuiz
Quiz App project from course ABND by Google in Udacity.

The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. It’s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. (Per the rubric, we require a minimum of 4 questions and a maximum of 10 quiz questions for a proper app submission).

This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Planning your app design before coding.
- Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
- Creating, positioning, and styling views.
- Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
- Commenting and documenting your code.
